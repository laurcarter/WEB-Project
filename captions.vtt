First, let’s talk about your introduction.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.000
A great hook can draw in the reader right away.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000
Try starting with a moment of conflict, humor, or reflection.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
Next, the body of your essay should reveal personal growth.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.000
Use specific examples from your life to make your story unique.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.000
Don’t try to impress — focus on being honest and reflective.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.000
The conclusion should tie everything together and show your future direction.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.000
Avoid clichés and summarize your deeper message.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.000
